    "# **Association between Abstract Characteristics and Ranking Position in Technology-Assisted Reviewing (TAR): coding set-up**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **by Isa Spiero <br>**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Part I: Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets are imported. These are the datasets based on the previously conducted systematic reviews by Andaur Navarro et al. and Heus et al., respectively. The titles and abstract of each record along with the title-abstract level inclusions, full-text level inclusions, and abstract characteristics are present in the dataset. The abstract characterstics consist of: (a) TRIPOD scores, (b) abstract structural components, and (c) abstract language usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Part II: Ranking** \n",
    "\n",
    "A screening tool (ASReview) is used to simulate the title-abstract screening by using active learning to rank and prioritize records that are most likely to be relevant for the review. These ranking algorithms use a feature extractor and classifier to compute rankings. The simulation is continued until all records have passed, and the final ranking is saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Part III: Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the evaluation, the association between abstract characteristics (as described under Data) and the ranking position (as computed with the tool during Ranking) is examined.\n",
