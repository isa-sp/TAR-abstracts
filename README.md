# Association between Textual Characteristics of Abstracts and Findability via Technology-Assisted Reviewing

### Description
This repository contains the code of a simulation study on the effects of textual characteristics on Technology-Assisted Reviewing (TAR) or semi-automated title-abstract screening for systematic reviews of prognosis.

### Python codes
- data_preprocessing.py

### Data
The prognosis reviews (Table 1) are listed and may become available in the data folder upon approval of the respective authors.
