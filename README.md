# Write Your Abstracts Carefully - Association between Textual Quality of Abstracts and Findability via Semi-Automated Screening

### Description
This repository contains the code of a simulation study on the effects of textual characteristics on semi-automated title-abstract screening or Technology-Assisted Reviewing (TAR) for evidence syntethesis, specifically for systematic reviews of prognosis studies.

### Python codes
- compute_rankings.py
- data_preprocessing.ipynb
- set-up.ipynb
  
### Data
The reviews (Table 1) are listed and the corresponding pmid's of the studies including the full-text labels are available in the data folder.
